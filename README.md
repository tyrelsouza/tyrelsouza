### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my selfhosted web service to keep track of book preorders.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and SDL2 for graphics engine programming for fun.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my many many hobbies.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: https://tyrel.dev/links
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm fantastic at finding four leaf clovers.

I stopped using GitHub for most things when a job made me make an enterprise account, and current work uses self hosted. Activity on GitHub fizzles after January 2022ish.
